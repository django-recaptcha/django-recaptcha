#. New release notes go here

1.2.1 (2017-01-23)
------------------

#. Made reCAPTCHA test keys the default keys for easy use in development. The
   captcha doesn't require any interaction, has a warning label that it's for
   testing purposes only, and always validates.

1.2.0 (2016-12-19)
------------------

#. Pass options as HTML data attributes instead of the ``RecaptchaOptions``
   JavaScript object in the default template. Custom templates using
   ``RecaptchaOptions`` should migrate to using HTML data attributes.

1.1.0 (2016-10-28)
------------------

#. Dropped support for old Django versions. Only the upstream supported
   versions are now supported, currently 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10.
#. Made recaptcha checking use SSL by default. This can be disabled by setting
   ``RECAPTCHA_USE_SSL = False`` in your Django settings or passing
   ``use_ssl=False`` to the constructor of ``ReCaptchaField``.
#. Made ReCaptchaField respect required=False

1.0.6 (2016-10-05)
------------------

#. Confirmed tests pass on Django 1.10. Older versions should still work.
#. Fixed a bug where the widget was always rendered in the first used language
   due to ``attrs`` being a mutable default argument.
